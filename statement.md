# 📄 STATEMENT.md — Notes Organiser Project

## 🔷 Problem Statement
Students and individuals often take multiple notes across different subjects, tasks, and topics. These notes are usually written in scattered formats (loose papers, phone reminders, notebooks, etc.), making it difficult to retrieve them when needed.  
There is a lack of a simple, lightweight, offline system that allows users to **store, organize, and search notes efficiently** without the need for complex software or internet access.

## 🔷 Scope of the Project
The Notes Organiser project provides a **basic text-based notes management system** that enables users to:
- Create and save notes permanently using file storage
- View all saved notes in an organized format
- Search for notes based on keywords
- Use a simple menu-driven interface without requiring technical knowledge

This project is intended to demonstrate Python core concepts such as loops, functions, and file handling while solving a real everyday problem of personal digital note storage.
